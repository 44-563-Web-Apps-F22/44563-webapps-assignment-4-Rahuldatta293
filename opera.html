       <h5>OPENING CHORUS</h5>
        <p>PRET. You certainly are a dear old thing.</p>
        <p class="song">In lazy languor—motionless,<br>
            We lie and dream of nothingness;<br>
            For visions come<br>
            From Poppydom<br>
            Direct at our command:<br>
            Or, delicate alternative,<br>
            In open idleness we live,<br>
            With lyre and lute<br>
            And silver flute,<br>
            The life of Lazyland.</p>

                <p>SOLO - Phylla.</p>

        <p class="song">The song of birds<br>
            In ivied towers;<br>
            The rippling play<br>
            Of waterway;<br>
            The lowing herds;<br>
            The breath of flowers;<br>
            The languid loves<br>
            Of turtle doves—<br>
            These simple joys are all at hand<br>
            Upon thy shores, O Lazyland!</p>
           <p>(calynx enters)</p>
       <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx: </h6> <p class="speeech"> Good news!  Great news!  His Majesty's eldest daughter,
        Princess Zara, who left our shores five years since to go to
        England—the greatest, the most powerful, the wisest country
        in the world—has taken a high degree at Girton, and is on
        her way home again, having achieved a complete mastery over all
        the elements that have tended to raise that glorious country to
        her present preeminent position among civilized nations!</p>
        <h6 class="Salata">Salata:</h6> <p class="speech">   Then in a few months Utopia may hope to be completely
            Anglicized?</p>
            <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx: </h6> <p>  Absolutely and without a doubt.</p>
            <h6>Melene: </h6> <p>  (lazily)  We are very well as we are.  Life without a
                care—every want supplied by a kind and fatherly monarch,
                who, despot though he be, has no other thought than to make his
                people happy—what have we to gain by the great change that
                is in store for us?</p>
            <h6 class="Salata"> Salata:<h6>   <p class="speech">What have we to gain?  English institutions, English
                tastes, and oh, English fashions!</p>
            <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h6>  <p class="speech"> England has made herself what she is because, in that
                favored land, every one has to think for himself.  Here we have
                no need to think, because our monarch anticipates all our wants,
                and our political opinions are formed for us by the journals to
                which we subscribe.  Oh, think how much more brilliant this
                dialogue would have been, if we had been accustomed to exercise
                our reflective powers!  They say that in England the conversation
                of the very meanest is a coruscation of impromptu epigram!</p>
            <h6 class="Tarara">Tarara:</h6>  <p class="speech"> Lalabalele talala!  Callabale lalabalica falahle!</p>
            <h6 class="Calynx">Calynx:</h6> <p class="speech">   (horrified)  Stop—stop, I beg!  (All the ladies
                close their ears.)</p>
