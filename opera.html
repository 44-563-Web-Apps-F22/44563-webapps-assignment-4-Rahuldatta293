       <h3>Thespis</h3>
       <h4>ACT-2</h4>
       <h5>SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
            of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
            interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
            of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
            back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it.  All the substitute
            gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered
            grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
            drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.</h5>
        <p>PRET. You certainly are a dear old thing.</p>
        <p>SILL. She says I'm a dear old thing.  Deputy Venus says I'm a
            dear old thing.</p>
        <p>NICE. It's her affectionate habit to describe everybody in those
            terms. I am more particular, but still even I am bound to admit
            that you are certainly a very dear old thing.</p>
            <p>SILL. Deputy Venus says I'm a dear old thing, and Deputy Diana
                who is much more particular, endorses it. Who could be severe
                with such deputy divinities.</p>
                <p>SILL. Venus is going to ask me a favour.</p>
                <p>PRET. You see, I am Venus.</p>
                <p>SILL. To Vulcan, my dear, to Vulcan. The exact connubial relation
                    of the different gods and goddesses is a point on which we must
                    be extremely particular.</p>
                    <p>PRET. I beg your pardonâ€”Venus is married to Mars.</p>
                    <p>NICE. If she isn't married to Mars, she ought to be.</p>
                    <p>NICE. If she isn't married to Mars, she ought to be.</p>
